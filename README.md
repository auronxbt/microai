## What is MicroAI?

MicroAI started as a simple pay-per-use AI chatbot on Arc Testnet. It has grown into a full knowledge and tooling hub for anyone building in the Arc + Circle ecosystem.

Every AI query costs **$0.001 USDC**, settled directly on-chain. No subscriptions, no accounts, no ETH needed.

## Features

### AI Chat (`/chat`)
- Ask any Arc or Circle question for $0.001 USDC
- Wallet signs USDC transfer on Arc Testnet before each response
- AI trained on Arc docs, Circle developer docs, CCTP, ERC-8004, ERC-8183
- Every answer comes with a verifiable on-chain TX proof
- Chat history saved locally across sessions
- Multi-wallet support: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, Brave

### Ecosystem Directory (`/ecosystem`)
- 44+ projects across 11 categories
- Real-time search and category filter
- Covers: AI Agents, Wallets, DEX, Bridges, Dev Tools, Payments, Stablecoins, Infrastructure, Lending, Institutions, Community Builds

### Grants & Hackathons (`/grants`)
- Live tracker for all Arc + Circle grants, hackathons, and bounties
- Status badges: OPEN, LIVE NOW, UPCOMING, ENDED
- Filter by type: GRANT, HACKATHON, BOUNTY, EVENT
- Direct apply links with reward and deadline info

### Transaction Debugger (`/debug`)
- Paste any Arc testnet TX hash
- Fetches real data from Arc Explorer API
- AI analyzes root cause: insufficient USDC, wrong chain, gas limit, contract revert, invalid input, nonce issues
- Shows severity level (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) with fix instructions
- Direct link to Arc Explorer for full TX details

### Live Network Stats (`/stats`)
- **Block height, gas price, chain ID** — pulled from Arc RPC every 10 seconds
- **MicroAI revenue counter** — live USDC balance on receiver wallet

## Architecture

```
User → Connect Wallet (Arc Testnet)
     → Ask Question
     → Wallet signs 0.001 USDC transfer on-chain
     → USDC settled on Arc (instant finality)
     → AI query sent to Groq with Arc+Circle knowledge base
     → Response returned with TX hash proof
     → User sees answer + verifiable TX link on arcscan
```

---

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahmedonchain/microai.git
cd microai
pnpm install
pnpm approve-builds
```

Create `.env.local`:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` — connect MetaMask to Arc Testnet to test payments.
